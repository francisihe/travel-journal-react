# Travel Journal Built Using React

## About The Travel Journal

This is my react practice app; built using React v17. 

I built this to try my hands on the React framework, making use of components and custom elements, styling with vanila CSS and with custom data in the data.js file and picture images from an external source - Unsplash.

This was built for medium and larger screens; smaller screens may perhaps be factored in much later.

## Need Extra Data Added?

You can add extra data in the data.js file using the same object structure in the array available within.


## To Run On Your Local Machine

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
